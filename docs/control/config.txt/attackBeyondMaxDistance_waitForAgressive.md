This config setting determines how openkore behaves when a ranged character has already damaged to their target, but the target is currently out of range.

If this parameter is **0** (old behavior), then openkore will move towards the monster.

If this parameter is set to **1** (new behavior), then openkore will wait in place until the wounded monster comes closer.

Appeared in :simple-github: [PR#3628](https://github.com/OpenKore/openkore/pull/3628)

!!! Note
    The following attack keys are meant to work only in private server (rAthena/Hercules). If you enable this in a official server you character will act weird, because character can't attack beyond the range.
