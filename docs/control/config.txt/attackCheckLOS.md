`attackCheckLOS` [`<boolean>`](../../References.md#boolean_flag){ data-preview }

This option toggles the use of LOS (Line Of Sight) check code when attacking.

If this option is enabled and you are a ranged attacker (i.e. [attackDistance](attackDistance.md) is set to a value greater than 2), this will check whether you have a clear line of sight to the target, if not, it will attempt to move to a space where you do while respecting [runFromTarget_dist](runFromTarget_dist.md) and [followDistanceMax](followDistanceMax.md).
